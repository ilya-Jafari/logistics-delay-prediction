## 📌 Project Overview
The **Logistics Intelligence Hub** is a next-generation decision-support system designed to mitigate supply chain risks. Unlike traditional dashboards that rely on static historical data, this platform combines **Machine Learning** with **Live Data Mining** and **Generative AI** to provide actionable insights for global logistics managers in 2026.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Predictive Analytics:** Uses a trained Random Forest model to calculate the probability of shipment delays based on historical shipping patterns, payment types, and regional factors.
- **Real-Time Data Mining:** Automatically scrapes and parses live logistics news from global RSS feeds (e.g., gCaptain, Loadstar) to capture the pulse of the industry.
- **Local AI Intelligence:** Integrated with **Llama 3 via Ollama** to analyze unstructured news data. It identifies geopolitical risks, port strikes, and maritime threats without sending sensitive data to the cloud.
- **Interactive UI:** A high-performance Streamlit dashboard that bridges the gap between raw data and executive decision-making.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Core:** Python 3.10+
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Generative AI:** Ollama, Llama 3 (Local LLM)
- **Data Scraping:** BeautifulSoup4, lxml, Requests
- **Visualization:** Streamlit, Tableau

## 🗺 The Vision: Roadmap to 3.0 (Scale & Future Growth)
This project is architected for massive scalability. While version 2.0 is a powerful diagnostic tool, it serves as the foundation for a **Fully Autonomous Logistics Ecosystem**:

### 1. Multi-Agent Workflows (Autonomous Agents)
Implementing frameworks like **CrewAI** or **LangGraph** to create a team of AI agents:
* *The Scout:* 24/7 autonomous web monitoring for specific port disruptions.
* *The Strategist:* Cross-references news with internal ML predictions to suggest alternative shipping routes.

### 2. Long-Term Memory (Vector Databases)
Integrating **ChromaDB** or **Pinecone** to store historical disruptions. This allows the AI to learn from the past (e.g., *"This strike in Rotterdam resembles the 2024 crisis, suggesting a 15-day recovery window"*).

### 3. Real-Time IoT & Asset Tracking
Expanding data input from static forms to live **API integrations** with GPS and AIS (Automatic Identification System) to track vessels and trucks in real-time on a global map.
